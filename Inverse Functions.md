# Inverse Functions

## Definition:

The inverse function for $f$, written $f^{-1}(x)$, undoes what $f$ does.

## Inverse function key facts

1. Inverse functions reverse the roles of $y$ and $x$.
2. The graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$ is obtained from the graph of $y = f(x)$ by reflecting over the line $x = y$.
3. $f^{-1} o f(x) = x$ and $f o f^{-1}(x) = x$. This is the mathematical way of saying that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ undo each other.
4. A function $f$ has an inverse function if and only if the graph of $f$ satisfies the horizontal line test.
5. For any invertible function $f$, the _domain_ of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the _range_ of $f(x)$ and the _range_ of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the _domain_ of $f(x)$.

## Notes
- $f^{-1}(x)$ means the inverse for $f(x)$. Note that $f^{-1}(x) \neq \frac{1}{f(x)}$
