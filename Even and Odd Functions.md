Whenever a pair (x, y) is on the graph, the point

1. $(x, -y)$ is also on the graph---> symmetric with respect to $x$
2. $(-x, y)$ is also on the graph---> symmetric with respect to $y$
3. $(-x, -y)$ is also on the graph---> has a $180ยบ$ around the origin.

a function $f(x)$ is:

- even if its graph is symmetric with the y-axis.
  $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all x-values in its domain.
  e.g. $f(x) = x^2 + 3$
- odd if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
  $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all x-values in its domain.
  e.g. $f(x) = 5x - 1/x$
